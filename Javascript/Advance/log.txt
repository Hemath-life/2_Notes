18 _ Class and Object 
          - Setters 
          - Getters 
          - Private variables
          -  Inheritance
          -  class like a blue print
          - if you not create constructor it create own constructor it self.
          - in class we don't need to specify the (var,let,const) keywords while creating the variable      =  [ :) ]
          -  private variables getter and setters
          - getter is allows to get variable data using functions , getting data
          - setting the data
          -  courseList = []; which means private variable  you can't access directly but you can access via class members                    =  [ :) ]


19 _  Inheritance ,  super() ,  static ?
          - inheritance Sharing the parents variables and function to the children's
          - Super allows to pass value to the parents.
          - Static makes to the function which is not shareable Makes private to the children's
