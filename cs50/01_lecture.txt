> What's computer ?
        _ computer used ot  solve a problem.
        _ computer understand and  'binary values'.
                - which is 0's and 1's values.

> What's Decimal  binary?
        _ Decimal understand by human.
               - Dec means 10 numbers 0 to 9.
        _ bi means "two".
        _ binary value is 0 and 1.

> computer psychical resource is electronic
        _ on or off
        _ yes or no 
        _ 0 or 1 
        all above same.
        _ here we use switch on or off to represent binary value. 1 on 0 off 
        _ transistor is tiny little switch.
        _ to show 2 Decimal to binary 2 switch trun on there some electricity will be given all of other switch will be off

>What's bit  and byte?
        _ bit is 0 and 1.
        _ byte is 8 bit .which means 8 0s and 8 1s.


> What's Transistors ?
        _ transistor is tiny little switch. which have millions or billions in our mobile and computer.
        _ if your want to represent  Decimal value 3  to binary  only 2  switch(2 transistor 2 (821->011)) is enough.
        and there only electric send and it represent where 3 values and store it.
        _ having 1 transistor we can create 2 combinations  0 1 . 2 transistor goes 2 combinations  0 1,1 0 etc.
        _when we want to increase the bit size it gonna increase Transistors.
        _in mobile we have billions of transistor.
        _example:
                -formula 120 ....... 16 8 4 2 1 to represent Decimal.
                -represent 3 number in binary 2 (421->011)transistor is enough.  
                -represent 10 number in binary 3(421->110)  transistor is enough.


> Ascii and unicode ?
        _ Ascii follow 8 bit only which is now enough now then we find unicode 
        _ unicode use 8 or 16 or 32 or 48 like

> whats algorithm ?
        _ step by step process to solve a problem
        _ find the name in phone book
               sudo code is syntax:
                1  pick up phone book
                2  open middle of the phone book
                3  look at the page
                4  if smith is on page
                5       funded
                6  else if smith is earlier in book
                7        open to middle of left half  of book
                8        go back to line 3
                9  else if smith is later in the book
                10      open to middle of right half  of book
                11       go to line 3 
                12 else
                        quite
